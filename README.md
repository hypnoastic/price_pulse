### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```zsh

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```zsh

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```zsh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users sign up/login using Firebase Authentication
   - Each user has their own product tracking list

2. **Product Tracking**:
   - Users paste Amazon product URLs
   - Backend scrapes initial product data
   - Data is stored in Firebase Firestore

3. **Price Monitoring**:
   - Backend scheduler runs every 20 minutes
   - Scrapes latest prices for all tracked products
   - Updates price history in Firestore

4. **Price Alerts**:
   - Users set target prices for products
   - When price drops below target:
     - User receives email notification
     - Alert is automatically removed

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Price history displayed as interactive charts
   - Real-time updates when new prices are fetched

## Security Features

- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Secure CORS policy
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Firebase security rules for data access

## Production Deployment
